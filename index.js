  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. "this" defaults to global object which is Window object in simple mode and defaults to undefined in strinct mode.
    2. "this" will be the owner of the constructor function and initialises as an empty hash
    3. "this" stores the element selected from DOM using getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector() or querySelectorAll()
    4. "this" also refers to the owner object while the method is defined inside an object.
